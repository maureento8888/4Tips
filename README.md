# 4Tips

Hackathon: National Society of Black Engineers) NSBEHacks UofT Chapter 2020
University of Toronto, St. George campus

4Tips is a web-based integrated resource for the Black community, particularly catering to the female natural hair community within - we offer a resource for different curl types and tailored hair care tips. In our literature review of University of Toronto's Gerstein Science Information Centre database (provider is Summon), we used the keywords "Black community", "hair care", and "black hair" to query the database. Journal articles were pulled from SAGE publications' Journal of Black Studies, The American Journal of Public Health, and PloS One. Journal articles were primarily multidisciplinary and qualitative in nature.

**Across African Diaspora, hair is synonymous with identity." Tefeh et al (2019)**

Our review showed that Black women require hair care needs that vary widely and quite uniquely from within a primarily Eurocentric society. On the same note, Black hair in African diaspora are regarded as integral to self-identity and self-expression. As such, Black natural hair vloggers offer empowerment and provide an outlet for their own and others' lived experiences (Neil & Mbilishaka, 2019). A study by Versey (2014) found that among Black women, many don't meet the recommended 150min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity due to issues with hair maintenance and needs. Yet, given the multidisciplinary nature of physical activity and widely accepted benefits, this topic is not talked about enough. Furthermore, hair products often contain a lot of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may lead an increase in breast cancer risk (Tefeh, et al 2019). Case in point, this is a necessary **conversation** to have.

## Getting Started
Given the intensive and innovative environment of a hackathon, we have not yet upgraded to a backend, with a potential for email subscription, url routing, and database.

Since the front end is largely built on Bulma CSS framework, you can directly clone or fork your version of the repo.

### Built with:
- Bulma CSS framework
- HTML5/CSS3
